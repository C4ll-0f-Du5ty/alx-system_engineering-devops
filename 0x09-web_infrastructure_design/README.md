# Simple Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview

This project outlines a simple web infrastructure design that hosts a web application using a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on a single server. The server is configured to be accessible via the domain `www.example.com`.

## Components

- **Server**: A single server running Linux, configured to host the web application.
- **Web Server (Apache)**: Handles HTTP requests and serves the web application.
- **Application Server (PHP)**: Executes the application logic.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores the application data.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A server with a public IP address.
- Domain name configured to point to the server's IP address.

### Installation

1. **Update the Server**: Ensure your server is up to date.
2. **Install LAMP Stack**: Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
3. **Configure Apache**: Ensure Apache is configured to serve your web application.
4. **Configure MySQL**: Create a database and user for your application.
5. **Deploy Your Application**: Upload your application files to the server and configure Apache to serve them.

## Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your server, Apache, MySQL, and PHP up to date.
- **Backup**: Regularly backup your database and application files.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor server performance and application health.
